# General Tips

* Twitch/Curse isn't working!

   The client *and* server files are available through the [FTB launcher](https://mc-launcher.com/launcher/ftb).



* The starting quest requires Oak and I have <not oak> sapling, help!

   Several different wood saplings are available through the in-game shop.


# Server Tips

* How do I choose a template when on a server?

   No additional configuration changes to the server configs are required. Once client logs in, and creates a team, they will be prompted to choose an island template.
